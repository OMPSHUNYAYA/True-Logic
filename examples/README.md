# STL Examples

This directory contains optional example descriptions related to STL verification runs.

No frozen artifacts are stored here.

All verification artifacts must be regenerated using the canonical scripts provided in:

`scripts/`

STL conformance is defined strictly by deterministic replay:

`B_A = B_B`

Users are expected to independently execute the verification commands rather than rely on pre-generated example outputs.

Authoritative replay-verified reference bundles, if provided, are located under:

`reference_outputs/`

This folder exists for structural clarity only.
