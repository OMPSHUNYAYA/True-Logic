Permission

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization to use, implement, reproduce, publish, distribute, reference, extend, or incorporate this Standard, in whole or in part, without restriction.

This permission applies to both commercial and non-commercial use.

No registration required.

No approval required.


No Restrictions

This Open Standard imposes no legal, technical, or commercial restrictions on use or implementation.

Attribution is not required.

No endorsement or certification is implied.

No runtime obligations apply.

No implementation approval is required.

Correctness and conformity are governed by structural behavior and deterministic replay, not by licensing terms.


Recommended Attribution (Optional)

Attribution is recommended but not required.

If provided, the preferred form is:

Implements Shunyaya True Logic (STL).

Attribution must not imply endorsement by the authors or the Shunyaya framework.

Use of the name “Shunyaya True Logic (STL)” must not imply:

• endorsement
• certification
• official compliance approval
• governance authority
• authorship by the original authors


Scope of the Standard

Shunyaya True Logic (STL) defines a deterministic structural collapse-governance layer over classical Boolean evaluation.

STL establishes:

Finite structural truth space:

T5 = {Z0, Eplus, S, Eminus, Zstar}

Deterministic structural operators:

NOT_s
AND_s
OR_s

Collapse mapping:

phi_T(S) = TRUE
phi_T(Zstar) = FALSE
phi_T(Z0) = UNDEFINED
phi_T(Eplus) = UNDEFINED
phi_T(Eminus) = UNDEFINED

Replay-verifiable determinism

Structural admissibility discipline

STL does not:

modify Boolean logic
modify domain equations
introduce predictive models
simulate system dynamics
perform optimization
guarantee safety outcomes

STL governs collapse admissibility, not causation.


Conformance

An implementation conforms to the STL Open Standard if it:

Preserves Boolean logic under collapse:

For stable endpoints:

phi_T(op_s(A,B)) = op_bool(phi_T(A), phi_T(B))
when A,B in {S, Zstar}

Produces deterministic classification over T5.

Defines structural operators closed over T5.

Produces byte-identical artifacts under independent replay:

B_A = B_B

Avoids probabilistic or tolerance-based arbitration.

Any implementation introducing:

randomness
probabilistic inference
adaptive tuning
tolerance-based collapse
nondeterministic output

does not conform to the STL Open Standard.

Independent implementations are permitted and encouraged.


Relationship to Other Licenses

This Open Standard applies only to the STL specification and normative structural definitions.

Reference implementations, adapters, tooling, or example scripts may be released under separate licenses if explicitly stated.

Implementation licensing does not alter structural conformance requirements of this Standard.

Nothing in this Standard grants trademark rights.


Responsibility

Use of STL in operational, governance, infrastructure, AI, or safety-critical contexts is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

STL provides structural collapse admissibility discipline and deterministic replay guarantees under declared scope.

It does not provide operational authority, certification, or safety guarantees.


No Warranty

THE STANDARD IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THIS STANDARD.


Closing Statement

Shunyaya True Logic (STL) is published as an Open Standard to maximize interoperability, independent verification, and deterministic correctness.

It is governed by structure — not by permission.
